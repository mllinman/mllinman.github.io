I started out pursuing a career as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer from the University of Phoenix while working active duty in the Marine Corps. I finished the course but never fully emerged in the field. After various deployments and recruitment into Special Operations I found myself working in the Film and Entertainment industry as a Nuke Compositor and 3D Generalist with a Bachelors of Science in Media Arts and Animation. After numerous layoffs and industry instability I find myself needing a stable and rewarding field that's challenging and growing at an exponential rate. Cybersecurity offers these aspects and is exactly what I've been looking for, thus begins my journey. I can see myself working as a Professional SOC member or on a Red Team pen testing for vulnerabilities.  

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst or PEN Tester
